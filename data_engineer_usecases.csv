Use Case,Situation,Behavior,Impact
Airflow Emailer (Data Platform – Colleague),"Email notifications for data operations were previously handled via AWS Lambda, which lacked ownership, compliance validation, and delivery tracking. The absence of delivery logs led to uncertainty in whether notifications reached the intended teams, impacting monitoring reliability and audit readiness.","Designed and implemented a new Airflow-based mailer framework to replace the legacy Lambda mailer. Integrated with Airflow DAGs for native email triggering, added configurable parameters, ensured compliance with email governance standards.","Enabled 100% traceability, reduced delivery failures by ~100%, improved team efficiency, and enhanced compliance adherence by ~40%."
DAG-to-DAG Trigger (Data Platform – Colleague),"No mechanism to manage DAG dependencies, causing manual triggers, delays, and missed SLAs.","Implemented DAG-to-DAG dependency framework using TriggerDagRunOperator and ExternalTaskSensor, standardized usage patterns, and documented integration steps.","Eliminated manual triggers, reduced monitoring effort by ~80%, and improved Airflow operational efficiency."
S3-to-DAG Trigger (Data Platform – Colleague),"No automated way to trigger Airflow DAGs based on new file arrivals in S3, leading to delays.",Developed event-driven orchestration with S3KeySensor and parameterized file pattern detection.,"Achieved end-to-end automation, improved data availability timeliness, and enhanced reliability."
Idempotent Ingestion Pipelines (Data Ingestion Effectiveness – Customer),Re-running ingestion pipelines caused duplicate data in Redshift due to non-idempotent logic.,"Redesigned ingestion to ensure deduplication, implemented UPSERTs, and validated correctness.","Eliminated duplicate data (100% idempotency), improved reliability and confidence in pipelines."
Eureka Reverse Feed Ingestion (Data Ingestion Effectiveness – Customer),Eureka’s reverse ingestion faced delivery issues and required manual coordination for backfills.,"Collaborated with Eureka team, optimized schedules, and documented monitoring/backfill processes.","Reduced manual dependency by ~95%, achieved 100% consistency, and improved team collaboration."
Custom Email Template for Airflow Alerting (Metric Observability – Community),Default Airflow alert emails were generic and missed critical failure details.,Developed custom HTML templates with dynamic details for better visibility and actionability.,"Reduced missed alerts by ~100%, improved MTTI, and enhanced platform observability."
Automated AWS & EMR Cost Reports (Metric Observability – Community),"No automated cost monitoring mechanism, leading to reactive anomaly detection.",Built Airflow DAG for AWS cost extraction and automated weekly email reports.,"Provided 100% visibility into costs, enabled cost savings, and improved accountability."
AppsFlyer Ingestion (Data Ingestion Effectiveness – Customer),"AppsFlyer API ingestion faced rate limits, high latency, and rising costs.",Built config-driven ingestion with dynamic time-windowing; collaborated to enable S3 export ingestion.,"Increased success rate from 70%→99%, reduced latency by ~40%, and cut ingestion cost by ~20%."
ECFM Implementation (Data Ingestion Execution – Customer),Pipeline failures due to Spark memory issues and timing misalignment.,"Tuned Spark memory configs, added exact-time execution logic, and optimized joins and caching.",Enhanced pipeline stability for time-sensitive ingestion workflows.
Document Classification (ML Integration – Customer),ML team needed foundational setup for Bedrock document classification testing.,"Created PostgreSQL metadata DB, Lambda + API Gateway for model invocation, and integrated Bedrock API.",Delivered working Dev prototype enabling early testing and validation cycles.
On-call Support (Operational Excellence – Platform),Frequent off-hour data pipeline failures needed rapid incident response.,"Monitored Airflow DAGs, performed triage, implemented permanent fixes, and documented recurring issues.","Improved reliability, reduced repeated incidents, and strengthened operational response."
